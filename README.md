## Starter Code
The starter code provided, labeled "starter.py", will showcase a very simple application. In the application, a label and button is used. 

## Widget Example
In the repository, there is code that is associated for each widget talked about in the blog. This includes labels, buttons, entries, frames, and scrollable frames. Each file can be easily found since the naming convention follows the format of "*widgetname*_example.py"

## Complex Application
In the repository, there is code that is associated for the complex application. The name of the file is "complex.py". This showcases an application with a navigation menu and a main window. You can choose to display two separate frames in the main window by pressing either button that is made in the navigation window.
